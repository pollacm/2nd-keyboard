; HELLO PEOPLES!
; IF YOU ARE NEW TO AUTOHOTKEY, YOU MUST AT LEAST TAKE THE FOLLOWING TUTORIAL:
; https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm
;
; You will need to know some basic scripting to custom tailor most
; of these scripts to your own machine, if you want to use them!
; VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
; This file works in tandem with ALL_MULTIPLE_KEYBOARD_ASSIGNMENTS.ahk.
; All the functions from HERE are actually CALLED from keyboard shortcuts
; in THAT script. I had to do it this way because of the Stream Deck(s)...
; But you can put your key bindings and functions in the same script if
; you want.
;------------------------------------------------------------------------

;update, just kidding. this script somehow, and very weirdly, interfered with ALL_MULTIPLE_KEYBOARD_ASSIGNMENTS.ahk -â€”so i just moced all of this crap over there.
